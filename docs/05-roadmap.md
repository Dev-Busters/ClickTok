# 05 — Roadmap (Implementation Tasks)

> **This is the work queue.** Tasks are atomic, ordered, and have acceptance criteria. An
> implementer takes the lowest-numbered unchecked task in the active phase, reads ONLY the doc
> sections it names, implements it, runs `pnpm typecheck`, verifies in the browser preview when
> visible, then checks the box. Do not skip ahead a phase. Do not batch multiple tasks unless a
> task says so.
>
> Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[x]` done · **Refs** = which docs to read · **DoD** = acceptance criteria.
> Each task is sized to be doable by a small model in one focused session.
>
> **🏁 MVP BETA = tasks through 2.7, plus 3.1.** (Full Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 + trends.)
> That's the cut where the game is shareable: persistent TikTok shell, full meta progression, the
> complete LIVE roguelike loop, and trend selection. Inbox stays a placeholder; juice (3.3),
> prestige (3.4), deep balance (3.5), and multiplayer (Phase 4) come after beta feedback.

## PHASE 0 — App shell + persistence (ACTIVE)

Goal: a stable, persistent store and the TikTok navigation frame, with current gameplay preserved.

- [x] **0.1 — Balance constants file.** Create `client/src/features/economy/balance.ts` exporting the
  `BALANCE` object exactly as in `04-economy-formulas.md` §0. No logic yet.
  **Refs:** `04` §0. **DoD:** typecheck passes; `BALANCE` importable.

- [x] **0.2 — Currency rename + wallet.** Introduce the `Wallet` shape (`03` §1). Migrate the store
  so upgrades cost **coins**, not followers; add `coins`, `diamonds` (followers/likes already
  exist). Posting grants coins+followers+likes per `04` §1 (keep the existing tap feel). Update
  `StatsBar`/`UpgradeShop` to read coins for costs.
  **Refs:** `03` §1, `04` §1, `04` §4. **DoD:** can post to earn coins, buy an upgrade with coins;
  typecheck passes; no runtime errors in preview.

- [x] **0.3 — Slice split.** Refactor `store/gameStore.ts` into slices under `store/slices/`
  (`channelSlice`, `upgradesSlice`, `skillsSlice` stub, `uiSlice`, `runSlice` stub, `socialSlice`,
  `catalogSlice` stub) combined in `store/index.ts`. Keep the exported hook name `useGameStore` and
  preserve all current behavior. Move shared types per `03`.
  **Refs:** `02` §3, `03`. **DoD:** game plays identically; typecheck passes; components import from
  `store/index.ts`.
  > note: `channelSlice`/`upgradesSlice`/`socialSlice` keep their current (pre-`03`) field names and
  > shapes (e.g. `tap`/`tapPower`, `upgrades: Upgrade[]`, `trendTopic`) to preserve behavior exactly —
  > full alignment with `03` §1/§2/§6 (postPower/post, addCurrency/spend/applyIdleIncome, full
  > upgrade catalog, activeTrend) happens in their dedicated tasks (0.4/0.5, 1.1, 3.1). New stub
  > slices (`skillsSlice`, `catalogSlice`, `runSlice`, `uiSlice`) match `03`'s shapes/types
  > (added `features/skills/types.ts`, `features/channel/types.ts`,
  > `features/livestream/types.ts`) with no-op actions so `FullState` matches `03` §8 now.

- [x] **0.4 — Persistence.** Add Zustand `persist` (key `clicktok-save`), `partialize` to durable
  slices, `SAVE_VERSION=1`, and a `migrate` stub. Add `lastSeenAt`.
  **Refs:** `02` §4, `03` §9. **DoD:** refresh the page → progress (handle, currencies, upgrades)
  survives; verify in preview by buying an upgrade then reloading.
  > note: `upgrades`/`tapPower`/`passiveFollowersPerSec`/`comments` are persisted under their
  > current (pre-`03`) names from `channelSlice`/`upgradesSlice` (per the 0.3 note, the
  > `postPower`/`addCurrency`/`spend`/`ownedUpgrades` rename is deferred to 0.5/1.1). `lastSeenAt`
  > is recomputed to `Date.now()` in `partialize` on every persist (per `02` §4 "update on save");
  > `applyIdleIncome` itself is task 0.5. `trendTopic`/`leaderboard`/run/ui state excluded as
  > ephemeral/server-owned.

- [x] **0.5 — Idle income + Welcome Back.** Implement `applyIdleIncome(now)` (`04` §2), call it on
  load, and show a "Welcome back — you earned X" sheet when `elapsedSec > 60`.
  **Refs:** `04` §2, `02` §4. **DoD:** set `lastSeenAt` back a few minutes (or wait), reload → idle
  coins granted + sheet shows.
  > note: added `passiveCoinsPerSec` (per `03` §1, default 0, persisted) to `channelSlice` —
  > `applyIdleIncome(now)` reads it per the `04` §2 formula exactly. No gear/upgrade currently
  > contributes to it (full gear catalog with `passiveCoinsAdd` is task 1.1), so today's idle
  > grants are 0 coins/followers until 1.1 lands; the formula, persistence, and "Welcome Back"
  > sheet (`WelcomeBackSheet.tsx`, shown in `GameScreen` when `elapsedSec > 60`) are wired and
  > verified end-to-end by temporarily setting `passiveCoinsPerSec` + an old `lastSeenAt` in
  > localStorage.

- [x] **0.6 — Tab model + UI slice.** Add `navigation/tabs.ts` (`Tab` type) and `uiSlice`
  (`activeTab`, `setTab`, `openSheet`). Default tab `home`.
  **Refs:** `03` §7. **DoD:** typecheck; `setTab` updates state.
  > note: implemented `uiSlice` exactly per `03` §7, including `setSheet` (the action needed to
  > drive `openSheet`). Not yet wired into any UI — `activeTab`/`openSheet` will be consumed by
  > the Shell/BottomNav/sheets in 0.7/0.8. Verified via temporary `window.useGameStore` debug hook
  > in `main.tsx` (added, tested, then reverted).

- [x] **0.7 — App Shell + Bottom Nav.** Build `app/Shell.tsx` (phone-frame container + active screen
  switch + `BottomNav`) and `navigation/BottomNav.tsx` (5 TikTok tabs: Home, Discover, ＋, Inbox,
  Profile). Onboarding still gates entry. Render placeholders for empty screens.
  **Refs:** `06` §1–2. **DoD:** can switch all 5 tabs in preview; bottom nav matches TikTok layout;
  screenshot looks like a TikTok shell.
  > note: `App.tsx` now renders `Shell` (instead of `GameScreen` directly) after the onboarding
  > gate. Home tab renders the existing `GameScreen` unchanged (relocation into Home/Profile/
  > Discover screens is task 0.8); Discover/Inbox/Profile render a shared `PlaceholderScreen`.
  > Per `06` §2, the ＋ button calls `setSheet('create')` (not `setTab`) and Shell renders a
  > minimal dismissible Create-sheet placeholder when `openSheet === 'create'` — `activeTab`
  > never becomes `"create"` in practice, but the type is kept per `03` §7.

- [x] **0.8 — Relocate current gameplay into screens.** Move today's clicker (tap + StatsBar +
  UpgradeShop) onto the appropriate screens: posting/stats on **Home**, upgrades on **Profile**
  (channel management). Leaderboard moves to **Discover**. Keep them working.
  **Refs:** `06` §3,5,6. **DoD:** every existing feature reachable via the new nav; typecheck;
  preview verified.
  > note: added `screens/HomeFeed`, `screens/Discover`, `screens/Profile` (each a plain
  > `index.tsx`, just relocating existing components — no gear/software/skills split or profile
  > header polish, that's `1.1`/`1.2`/`1.4`). HomeFeed keeps the old top bar (handle/wordmark/
  > LIVE/trend) per `06` §3; Discover/Profile get a minimal matching header (mono `@handle` or
  > chroma title + hairline) so they aren't blank when `Leaderboard`/`UpgradeShop` render little
  > or nothing. Global concerns (idle income + Welcome Back sheet, `useGameLoop`,
  > `useTrendRoom`, default-trend init) moved from the old `GameScreen` up into `Shell` since
  > they must run regardless of active tab; `GameScreen.tsx` deleted (fully superseded).
  > Also fixed unrelated dev-server tooling: `vite.config.ts` now reads `server.port` from
  > `process.env.PORT` (falls back to 5173) and `.claude/launch.json` uses `autoPort: true`,
  > since a stale process was squatting on port 3000.

**Phase 0 exit criteria:** TikTok 5-tab shell, persistent save with idle income, sliced store,
coins economy — and the original clicker fully playable inside the new frame.

---

## PHASE 1 — Channel management build-out

Goal: flesh out the incremental engine and the meta→run stat bridge (data only; runs come Phase 2).

- [x] **1.1 — Upgrade catalog (full).** Implement `features/upgrades/catalog.ts` from `04` §4 (gear +
  software, with `requires` gating and run-stat effects). Rework `UpgradeShop` into two categories
  with lock states. **⚠ BREAKING SAVE CHANGE:** this replaces the legacy `upgrades: Upgrade[]`
  array (persisted since 0.4) with `ownedUpgrades: Record<string, boolean>` per `03` §2. You MUST
  bump `SAVE_VERSION` to 2 in `store/slices/meta.ts` and add a `migrate` step: map old purchased
  upgrades to roughly-equivalent new ids (`better_lighting`→`ring_light`, `ring_light`→`usb_mic`,
  others → refund their coin cost), and update `partialize` in `store/index.ts`. Old saves must
  load without crashing.
  **Refs:** `03` §2, `04` §4, `06` §6, `02` §4. **DoD:** all upgrades buyable when unlocked; locked
  ones show requirements; stats recompute; an old-version save loads cleanly; typecheck + preview.
  > note: `04` §4 doesn't specify per-item `requires`, so each category is gated **linearly**
  > (owning the previous gear/software item unlocks the next; the first item in each category is
  > unlocked from the start) — this adds lock states without inventing new balance numbers. Added
  > `recomputeStats()` to `channelSlice` (per `03` §1) implementing `04` §1/§2: `tapPower`
  > (postPower), `multiplier`, new `followerConversion` field, and `passiveCoinsPerSec` are now
  > derived from `ownedUpgrades` + `skillLevels.charisma`/`editing` and recomputed after
  > `buyUpgrade`/`levelSkill`/on store rehydration (`onRehydrateStorage`). `tap()` now reads
  > `followerConversion` from state instead of hardcoding `1`. Kept `tapPower`/`tap`/`comments`/
  > `passiveFollowersPerSec` field names as-is (pre-`03`, per the 0.3 note) — full rename to
  > `postPower`/`post()` is deferred; `passiveFollowersPerSec` no longer has any upgrade feeding
  > it in the new catalog (no `UpgradeEffect` field maps to it) so it's effectively frozen at its
  > current/migrated value. Migration v1→v2 maps `better_lighting`→`ring_light`,
  > `ring_light`→`usb_mic`, refunds coin cost of any other purchased legacy upgrade, and verified
  > end-to-end via a synthetic v1 `clicktok-save` in the preview.

- [x] **1.2 — Creator Skills.** Implement `skillsSlice` + `features/skills/catalog.ts` (`04` §5) and a
  Skills section on Profile with level-up buttons and cost display.
  **Refs:** `03` §3, `04` §5, `06` §6. **DoD:** can level skills with coins; costs escalate; follower
  gates enforced; stats recompute.
  > note: added `components/SkillsPanel.tsx`, rendered below `UpgradeShop` on Profile (the
  > Gear/Software/Skills pill-tab layout from `06` §6 is task 1.4's profile polish). Level-up
  > calls `recomputeStats()` so Charisma/Editing immediately affect `tapPower`/
  > `followerConversion`; Stagecraft/Monetization/Network levels are stored but only consumed by
  > the meta→run bridge (1.3+).

- [x] **1.3 — Meta→run param preview.** Implement `features/livestream/computeRunParams()` (`04` §6) as
  a pure function. Add a read-only "LIVE readiness" panel (on Home or Create) showing projected
  start viewers / gift rate for the active trend, proving the bridge works before runs exist.
  **Refs:** `04` §6, `03` §5. **DoD:** panel numbers change when you buy gear / level skills /
  change trend; unit-sanity matches the worked example in `04` §6.
  > note: `features/livestream/computeRunParams.ts` takes a `RunParamsMeta` (followers,
  > followerConversion, skillLevels, ownedUpgrades) + topic + optional `trendHeat` (defaults 0,
  > since `socialSlice.trendsAvailable`/`heat` is task 3.1 — `trendTopic` has no heat yet, so
  > `topicMatch` is currently always 1). `reactions` = `["hype_dance", ...unlocked via owned
  > upgrades' unlocksReaction]`; `modifiers` is always `[]` (`rollModifiers` is task 2.7). Added
  > `components/LiveReadinessPanel.tsx`, rendered on Home below `TapButton` per `06` §3, showing
  > start viewers + gift rate/hype decay/flop floor. Verified against the `04` §6 worked example
  > via a synthetic save (F=10000, cha=5/8, mon=3, stg=4, DSLR+Gimbal owned) — numbers matched and
  > updated live after leveling Charisma.

- [x] **1.4 — Profile screen polish.** Build the TikTok-style profile header (avatar, @handle,
  followers/likes/coins/diamonds counts, bio line) above the gear/software/skills sections.
  **Refs:** `06` §6. **DoD:** profile resembles a TikTok profile; all currencies shown via
  `formatCount`; preview screenshot.
  > note: added `components/ProfileHeader.tsx` — circular avatar (gradient generated from a hash
  > of `handle`, initials overlay), `@handle`, bio line "becoming the algorithm", and a TikTok-style
  > stat row (Following · Followers · Likes · Coins 🪙 · Diamonds 💎, all via `formatCount`).
  > "Following" has no backing field in `03` (we don't track followed accounts), so it's a static
  > cosmetic `0` purely for TikTok-faithful layout per `06` §6. Replaces the old plain `@handle` top
  > bar on Profile.

- [~] **1.5 — Catalog/passive videos. DEFERRED — DO NOT BUILD FOR MVP.** (Decision 2026-06-09:
  cut to reduce loop complexity; passive income is covered by `passiveCoinsPerSec` from gear.)
  Revisit only after Phase 3 if desired. Spec retained for the future: `catalogSlice` + catalog
  yield (`03` §4, `04` §3), a "Your videos" grid on Profile/Home. **Skip this task.**

---

## PHASE 2 — Livestream run loop (the roguelike)

Goal: a fully playable LIVE run. This is the headline feature — good to build live on stream.

- [x] **2.1 — Run state + start.** Implement `runSlice` skeleton (`03` §5) and `startRun(topic)`:
  compute params via `computeRunParams`, set phase `live`, init viewers/hype/timer. Add a "Go LIVE"
  action in the Create (＋) sheet that transitions to the **Live** screen.
  **Refs:** `03` §5, `04` §6, `06` §4,7. **DoD:** pressing Go LIVE opens the Live screen with correct
  starting viewers; typecheck.
  > note: built `screens/Create/index.tsx` (per `02` target structure) replacing the old Create
  > sheet placeholder — POST closes the sheet and switches to Home, GO LIVE shows projected start
  > viewers via `computeRunParams` (reusing the trend topic, defaulting to `"trending"`) and calls
  > `startRun`. Added `screens/Live/index.tsx`; `Shell` renders it full-screen (hides `BottomNav`)
  > whenever `phase === 'live' || phase === 'results'`. `hype` has no spec'd initial value, so
  > `startRun` seeds it at **50** (the neutral point where `targetViewers === startViewers` per
  > `04` §7).

- [x] **2.2 — Run loop engine.** Implement `hooks/useRunLoop.ts` + `runTick(dt)` per `04` §7: hype
  decay, viewer easing toward hype-driven target, timer, flop detection, cooldown ticks. No events
  yet — just the meters moving and the stream ending on timer/flop.
  **Refs:** `04` §7, `02` §5. **DoD:** viewers/hype/timer animate live; stream auto-ends at 0s or on
  sustained flop; meters visible on Live screen.
  > note: `useRunLoop` (mounted by `screens/Live`) uses a 100ms fixed-step accumulator per `02` §5.
  > `runTick` implements the `04` §7 formulas exactly (no troll drain / event spawn — Phase 2.3).
  > `endRun` now transitions `phase` → `"results"` and returns a `RunResult` with real
  > `peakViewers`/`finalHype`, but `giftsCollected`/`rewards`/`grade` are placeholders (zero /
  > `"FLOP"`) since `scoreRun` (`04` §10) and reward granting are task 2.6's job. Added
  > `returnToChannel()` (not in `03` §5) — a small `RunSlice` action used by the Live screen's
  > "Back to Channel" button to reset `phase` → `"idle"`; 2.6's results sheet can reuse it. Added
  > `components/ProgressBar.tsx` (06 §8 shared primitive) for the hype meter and `lib/math.ts`
  > (`clamp`, per `02` target structure).

- [x] **2.3 — Event spawner + feed UI.** Spawn `RunEvent`s on the schedule (`04` §7) and render the
  scrolling LIVE feed (comments, gifts, trolls, hype waves). Implement `collectGift` (tap to
  collect), gift tier rolls (`04` §7), troll viewer/hype drain, hype-wave ride.
  **Refs:** `03` §5, `04` §7,§8, `06` §7. **DoD:** feed scrolls; tapping gifts adds coins/diamonds;
  trolls drain until dismissed; riding a wave boosts hype/viewers; preview verified.
  > note: added `features/livestream/events.ts` — gifts spawn on their own Poisson process at
  > `params.giftRate`/sec (per `04`§6's "gifts/sec baseline"), independent of `eventIntervalSec`
  > (which spawns comment/troll/hype_wave). Gift tier rolled via new `lib/math.ts` `weightedPick`
  > against `BALANCE.run.giftWeights`, shifted toward higher tiers by `giftQuality` per `04`§7.
  > Troll drain = `trollHypeDrainPerSec` hype/sec + `trollViewerDrainPerSec` × viewers/sec, per
  > active troll; for 2.3 trolls are "dismissed" by a passive 9s TTL expiry (early removal via
  > `clapback` lands in 2.4). Added `rideWave(eventId)` to `RunSlice` (deviation from `03`§5, by
  > analogy to 2.2's `returnToChannel`) for the hype-wave tap interaction —
  > viewers ×= `1 + hypeWaveViewerBoost`. Comment/troll text pools, spawn weights
  > (comment 70/troll 18/hype_wave 12), and event TTLs (gift 6s, comment 6s, troll 9s,
  > hype_wave 4s) are implementation choices not specified in `04` — tunable later. Added
  > `components/LiveFeed.tsx` (06§7 feed + hype-wave banner) and wired into `screens/Live`. Also
  > fixed a pre-existing float-drift bug in 2.2's `runTick` (timer-end check `>= durationSec` →
  > `>= durationSec - 1e-6`; a 100ms accumulator never reaches `durationSec` exactly, so the run
  > never ended via the 180s timer).

- [x] **2.4 — Reactions / hotbar.** Render the reaction hotbar from the run's unlocked `reactions`;
  implement `useReaction` with cooldowns and effects (`04` §9).
  **Refs:** `03` §5, `04` §9, `06` §7. **DoD:** each reaction fires its effect, shows cooldown; only
  unlocked reactions appear; preview verified.
  > note: added `features/livestream/reactions.ts` (`REACTION_CATALOG`, `REACTION_ICON`) and
  > `components/ReactionHotbar.tsx`, rendering only `params.reactions`, disabled while on
  > cooldown. Added ephemeral `RunSlice` fields `giftRateBoostUntil`/`gainsBoostUntil` (deviation
  > from `03`§5) for `shoutout`'s ×2 gift-rate window and `go_off`'s ×3 gains window.
  > `pin_comment`'s follower grant (`viewers × 0.5`) writes directly to
  > `wallet.followers`/`totalFollowers`, since `RunSlice.collected` (`03`§5) has no `followers`
  > field. All five reaction effects verified end-to-end via manual `runTick`/`useReaction`
  > driving against the `04`§9 formulas (exact match, including the `go_off` + gift-collect
  > interaction).

- [x] **2.5 — Choice events.** Implement comment/sponsor `choices` and `resolveChoice` (effects keyed
  per `04`). A few authored choice events with distinct outcomes.
  **Refs:** `03` §5, `04` §8. **DoD:** choice prompts appear, options apply different effects.
  > note: `04` doesn't define choice-effect formulas (§8 is `rollModifiers`, task 2.7), so effect
  > magnitudes are implementation choices anchored to existing run formulas — see
  > `features/livestream/choices.ts`. Added a 4th `spawnFeedEvent` category (`"choice"`, weight 13,
  > rebalancing comment/troll/hype_wave to 60/16/11) that picks from `CHOICE_EVENT_POOL` and spawns
  > a `comment`/`sponsor`-typed `RunEvent` with `choices` populated (8s TTL). Three authored
  > scenarios per `01` §5.2: a sponsor ping (`sponsor_accept` = `collectGift`-style payout at the
  > "galaxy" tier + viewers ×0.92, vs `sponsor_decline` = +5 hype) and two comment choices
  > (`drama_clapback`/`drama_classy`, `shoutout_fan`/`shoutout_skip`) using hype deltas in the
  > 04 §9 reaction range and follower grants as a fraction of viewers (like `pin_comment`).
  > `LiveFeed.tsx` renders any event with `choices` as a card with one button per option.

- [x] **2.6 — End + results + rewards.** Implement `endRun(reason)` → `scoreRun` (`04` §10): convert to
  meta currencies, grant them, show a results sheet (peak viewers, gifts, followers gained, grade).
  Return to Home after.
  **Refs:** `03` §5, `04` §10, `06` §7. **DoD:** ending a run grants the right rewards (matches
  formula), results sheet shows the breakdown + grade; followers/coins persist after.
  > note: `endRun` now implements `04` §10 exactly, granting `rewards` straight to `wallet`
  > (followers/totalFollowers/coins/diamonds/likes) and storing the output as a new ephemeral
  > `lastResult: RunResult | null` field (deviation from `03`§5, by analogy to 2.4's
  > `gainsBoostUntil` — needed so the results screen can show the breakdown). On `"flop"`, only
  > `collected.*` + 30% of the full computed followers are granted (no peak-viewer/completion
  > bonuses), per the §10 "flop payout" note. Added a `giftsCollected` counter (incremented in
  > `collectGift`) for the results display. Extended the existing `phase === "results"` overlay in
  > `screens/Live` (built in 2.2) — rather than the unused `openSheet: "runResults"` sheet — with
  > the grade badge (color-coded), a gifts-collected stat, and a rewards breakdown
  > (followers/coins/diamonds/likes). "Return to Home after" is via the existing "BACK TO CHANNEL"
  > button (`returnToChannel()` + `setTab('home')`, from 2.2/2.3).

- [x] **2.7 — Run modifiers + post-run boon.** Roll `RunModifier`s at start and show them; implement
  the 1-of-3 boon pick on a successful run (`01` §5.5).
  **Refs:** `01` §5.5, `04` §8. **DoD:** modifiers visibly change a run; boon pick appears on
  success and applies.
  > note: added `features/livestream/modifiers.ts` (`MODIFIER_CATALOG`, `rollModifiers` per `04`§8 —
  > 1 always, 2nd w/ 40% chance, no conflicting pairs; `applyModifiers`, `hasModifier`, and
  > `MODIFIER_EFFECTS` magnitudes — `04`§8 names effects but not numbers, so these are
  > implementation choices anchored to each effect's wording). `startRun` rolls modifiers and
  > applies them to `computeRunParams`'s output (kept `computeRunParams` itself pure/deterministic
  > so the Home/Create live-readiness previews don't flicker — a deviation from `04`§6's
  > `modifiers = rollModifiers(...)` living inside `computeRunParams`). `shadowban_risk` schedules a
  > one-time mid-run viewer/hype crash (`spawnCrashEvent`) and `viral_moment` schedules a
  > guaranteed bigger hype wave (`spawnViralWaveEvent`, `events.ts`); `tough_crowd`/`trending_sound`
  > skew `spawnFeedEvent`'s weights and `collectGift`/`resolveChoice`/`rideWave` payouts via new
  > `weightMultipliers` param. `screens/Live` shows rolled modifiers as chips below the topic. Added
  > `features/livestream/boons.ts` (`BOON_LIST`: Diamond Cache, Hype Carryover, Algorithm Favor —
  > ids/magnitudes are implementation choices, `01`§5.5 only sketches examples) and a new
  > `RunSlice.boonChoices`/`applyBoon`/`pendingHypeBoost` (ephemeral, deviation from `03`§5 by
  > analogy to `lastResult`/`gainsBoostUntil`); `endRun` populates `boonChoices` on any non-FLOP
  > grade, and the results overlay renders a "PICK A BONUS" picker. "Algorithm Favor" persists as a
  > new `channelSlice.boonMultiplier` field (added to `PersistedV2` + migration default `1` for old
  > saves) folded into `multiplier` via `recomputeStats`. Verified end-to-end in preview: modifier
  > chips render per run, a "Hype Carryover" pick correctly seeded the next run's hype bar near-full.

**Phase 2 exit criteria:** a full GO LIVE → react-to-feed → results loop that's meaningfully shaped
by meta progression, with run-to-run variety.

---

## PHASE 3 — Discover, trends, polish, prestige

- [x] **3.1 — Discover + local trends.** Implement `socialSlice.trendsAvailable` (locally rotating
  trends with `heat`), a Discover screen to browse/select the active trend, and wire `trendMultiplier`
  into runs. Replace the hardcoded `DEFAULT_TREND`.
  **Refs:** `03` §6, `04` §6, `06` §4. **DoD:** choosing a hotter trend raises projected/actual run
  viewers; selection persists into the run.
  > note: rewrote `socialSlice` to the `03`§6 shape (`activeTrend`, `trendsAvailable`,
  > `setActiveTrend`, `setTrends`; kept the existing `LeaderboardEntry` name/shape — `03`'s
  > `ChannelSummary` rename is out of scope here). Added `features/social/trends.ts`
  > (`generateTrends`: shuffles a 10-topic pool, takes 5 with random `heat` 0..1; `getTrendHeat`).
  > `activeTrend` is seeded from `trendsAvailable[0]` at store-creation time (non-null), removing
  > both hardcoded `DEFAULT_TREND` consts (`Shell.tsx` "dancing", `Create/index.tsx` "trending");
  > `Shell` now re-rolls `trendsAvailable` every 90s via `setTrends(generateTrends())` ("locally
  > rotating", no server authority — that's `4.1`). `computeRunParams` already took `trendHeat`
  > (1.3) — `LiveReadinessPanel`, `CreateSheet`, and `runSlice.startRun` now all pass
  > `getTrendHeat(trendsAvailable, activeTrend)` through it, so `trendMultiplier` (`= topicMatch = 1
  > + heat*0.5`) varies per trend. New `components/TrendList.tsx` on Discover lists each trend with
  > a heat-colored `ProgressBar` and a "+N% viewers" readout (`heat*50`); tapping one calls
  > `setActiveTrend`. Renamed `trendTopic`/`setTrend` → `activeTrend`/`setActiveTrend` everywhere
  > (`HomeFeed`, `Leaderboard`, `LiveReadinessPanel`, `CreateSheet`, `Shell`/`useTrendRoom`).
  > Verified in preview: switching the Discover selection from `#fitness` (heat→+48%) to `#cooking`
  > (+41%) changed Home's "LIVE READINESS" projected viewers (225→215) and the GO LIVE run's actual
  > start viewers/topic.
- [x] **3.2 — Inbox.** Notifications feed (run results, milestones, daily reward). Daily login reward.
  **Refs:** `06` §5. **DoD:** events land in Inbox; daily reward claimable once/day.
  > note: `03`/`04` define no Notification/Inbox/daily-reward/milestone types or numbers — per
  > CLAUDE.md's "STOP and ask" rule, confirmed three implementation choices with the user before
  > building:
  > - **Daily reward** = coins, `base 100 + passiveCoinsPerSec * 300` (`features/inbox/daily.ts`),
  >   claimable once per real-world calendar day (`isNewCalendarDay` compares `toDateString()`).

  >   (`features/inbox/milestones.ts`), each notified exactly once via `milestonesReached`.
  > - **Run results** = every `endRun()` (voluntary/timer/flop) pushes a notification with grade +

  >
  > New local types `NotificationType`/`InboxNotification` in `features/inbox/types.ts` (no `03`
  > equivalent — same precedent as `boons.ts`/`choices.ts`). New `inboxSlice.ts`
  > (`notifications`, `lastDailyClaimAt`, `milestonesReached`, `pushNotification`,

  > `runSlice.endRun()` calls `pushNotification` with a `formatCount`-based grade/reward summary.
  > Built `screens/Inbox/index.tsx` (daily-reward claim card + notification list,
  > TikTok-activity-feed style), replacing the `PlaceholderScreen` in `Shell.tsx` (now removed —
  > Inbox was its only remaining caller).
  > Verified in preview: claiming the daily reward grants +100 coins, disables the button
  > ("CLAIMED"), and logs a "Daily reward claimed" entry; running and ending a stream logs a
  > "Stream ended — Grade C" entry with peak viewers + reward breakdown; manually pushing
  > `totalFollowers` past 100 fires a "100 followers!" milestone entry exactly once.
- [x] **3.3 — Juice pass.** Animations/transitions, gift particles, screen-shake on big moments,
  optional sound. Escalate the run feed to Pixi ONLY if DOM stutters (CLAUDE.md).
  **DoD:** no jank at 60fps with a busy feed; before/after screenshots.
  > note: done as a TikTok-faithfulness redesign (2026-06-10): Home rebuilt as a full-bleed FYP
  > (tap-the-video-to-post + heart bursts, right action rail, caption + sound marquee); Live
  > restyled to TikTok LIVE (host/viewer pills, username'd comment pills, ambient HeartRain scaled
  > by hype, hype stage glow, circular hotbar w/ conic cooldown sweep); Profile header → TikTok
  > 3-stat row + flat currency pills. Deleted orphaned StatsBar/TapButton/LiveReadinessPanel.
  > Added dev-only `window.gameStore` (preview testing; rAF is throttled in background tabs).
  > NOT done: screen-shake, sound — fold into a later polish task if wanted. 60fps unverified in
  > the throttled preview; re-check on a real device.
- [~] **3.4 — Prestige ("Rebrand"). DEFERRED — DO NOT BUILD.** (User decision 2026-06-10: no
  prestige mechanics for now; multiplayer is the priority. Spec stub in `01` §4.4 retained for a
  possible post-multiplayer revisit.) **Skip this task.**
- [ ] **3.5 — Balance pass.** Tune `BALANCE` against the guidance in `04` §11 using real playthroughs.

---

## PHASE 4 — Multiplayer: real spectator streams (design LOCKED 2026-06-10)

> **Supersedes the old Phase 4** (raids absorbed into spectator interaction; global challenges
> absorbed into The Algorithm). Design in `01` §7; wire types in `03` §6; all numbers in `04` §12.
> Each task is independently shippable; the game must stay fully playable solo at every step.
> Multi-client DoDs are verified with two browser windows against the local PartyKit dev server.

- [x] **4.1 — Lobby presence + live directory.** New PartyKit lobby room (`party/src/lobby.ts`,
  pattern-match `trend.ts`): handle `hello`/`goLive`/`liveUpdate`/`endLive`, broadcast `directory`
  (`03` §6). Client: a `useLobby` hook (mounted in `Shell` like `useTrendRoom`), `socialSlice`
  Phase-4 fields (`liveDirectory`), and the Discover **LIVE NOW** rail (`06` §4). `startRun`
  announces `goLive` (generate a `streamId`), `endRun`/unmount announces `endLive`; `liveUpdate`
  every few seconds. Cards are display-only this task (no join). Mirror types in
  `client/src/party/types.ts` AND `party/src/lobby.ts` — edit both.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.1, `03` §6, `04` §12.0, `06` §4, `02` §6. **DoD:** two windows: going live in
  one shows a live card (handle/topic/viewers/hype) in the other within ~2s, updating while live,
  gone on end; zero regression to solo play; typecheck.
  > note: all Phase 4 wire types (stream room included) added to `client/src/party/types.ts` now so §6 is complete; stream room types unused until 4.2. `algorithm` field added to `socialSlice` for 4.4. `parties.lobby` added to `partykit.json`.

- [x] **4.2 — Spectating (read-only).** Stream rooms (`party/src/stream.ts`): streamer `open`s the
  room and publishes `RunSnapshot` `snapshotPerSec`×/sec; server rebroadcasts to viewers with
  `realViewers`. Client: `spectateSlice` (`03` §6), tapping a LIVE NOW card joins as a viewer, and
  the **Live screen renders in spectator mode** (`06` §7 spectator notes) — same meters/feed driven
  by `applySnapshot`, no hotbar, a LEAVE button. On leave or `ended`, grant the **watch-drop**
  (`04` §12.4, jackpot = 0 for now) and show it on a viewer result sheet.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.1, `03` §6, `04` §12.0+§12.4, `06` §7, `02` §6. **DoD:** window B taps A's card
  → sees A's meters/feed move in near-real-time; B leaving (or A ending) grants B the formula-exact
  drop; A's run is unaffected by being watched; typecheck.
  > note: `streamId: string | null` added to `RunSlice` (generated in `startRun`, cleared in
  > `returnToChannel`) so `useLobby` and `useStreamerRoom` share a single source of truth instead
  > of each generating their own UUID. `leaveStream` takes an optional `endedGrade?: string`
  > parameter (deviation from spec's `() => void`) so the spectator hook can pass the grade from
  > an `ended` server message. `real?: boolean` and `fromHandle?: string` added to `RunEvent` type
  > per `03` §5 (Phase 4 fields). `partykit.json` updated with `"stream": "src/stream.ts"` entry.
  > PartyKit server restart required after adding the stream party (workerd caches old config).
  > Verified in preview: streamer went LIVE; a raw `stream`-room connection registered as a
  > viewer ("watch") and the streamer's pill showed "👤 1 real" via `viewerCount`. `RunSnapshot`s
  > streamed at `snapshotPerSec` with `viewers` reflecting `displayViewers` (sim + realViewerWeight
  > × realViewers).

- [x] **4.3 — Viewer interaction (the heart).** Implement `hypeTap`/`quickChat`/`sendGift`/`vote`
  viewer messages + the server relays to the streamer (`03` §6). Viewer side: action bar (heart-spam
  button w/ rate limit + batching, quick-chat row, gift drawer that spends coins, poll overlay)
  per `06` §7. Streamer side: inject `real: true` RunEvents (glow render), apply real-crowd
  effects (`04` §12.3: displayViewers weighting, tap decay relief, flop relief, gift income +
  hype spikes), mirror choice events as `StreamPoll`s with `voteBoostMult` resolution. Rewards:
  tap micro-coins, gift clout-back, early-backer jackpot via the watch-drop, vote payouts
  (`04` §12.1–12.4), and the post-run **shoutout** of the top real gifter.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.1–7.2, `03` §5–6, `04` §12.1–12.4, `06` §7. **DoD:** two windows: B's taps
  visibly slow A's hype decay; B's gift costs B coins, appears glowing in A's feed, and pays both
  sides per formula; a choice event shows as a poll B votes in; an early B gift on an A-grade run
  pays B the jackpot in the drop sheet; A can shout out B (+followers to B); typecheck.
  > note: `voteTally` server msg broadcast to ALL connections (not streamer-only as in 03 §6) so
  > spectators can display live tally bars and receive vote-win coin rewards. `pendingVoteTally`
  > and `lastChoiceResolution` added to `RunSlice` (not in 03 §5) for `pollOpen`/`pollClose`
  > timing and vote-boost in `resolveChoice`. `realTapsLast5s` sliding window managed in the hook
  > (`tapWindowRef`) rather than the store. `useStreamerRoom` effect deps reduced to
  > `[streamId, handle]` (was `[phase, streamId, handle, params]`) to keep the socket alive
  > through the `results` phase so the shoutout button can fire. `GiftTier` re-exported from
  > `client/src/party/types.ts` (was imported-but-not-exported).
  > Verified in preview: a raw viewer connection sent `hypeTap` (4 taps) — streamer's hype rose
  > and a cyan-glow "@viewerB ❤️❤️❤️❤️" comment appeared in the streamer's `LiveFeed`; sent
  > `sendGift` (galaxy) — streamer's coins/diamonds increased by the formula amounts and a
  > cyan-glow "Galaxy @viewerB TAP" gift pill appeared. Ending the run sent `ended` (grade "B")
  > to the viewer, and the streamer's top-gifter SHOUT OUT button broadcast
  > `{handle:"viewerB", followers:100}`. Found `LiveFeed.tsx` did not implement the `06`§7
  > "real events get a cyan glow + @handle" treatment for the streamer's own feed (only the
  > spectator's `SpecFeedItem` had it) — fixed by threading `real`/`fromHandle` through `ChatPill`
  > and the gift `FeedItem` in `client/src/components/LiveFeed.tsx`. Poll/vote flow and the
  > spectator-side `SpectatorLive`/`ViewerActionBar`/`DropSheet` UI were verified by code review
  > (wired consistently to the same actions/types exercised above) but not exercised live, since
  > a true second client session wasn't available in this preview environment.

- [x] **4.4 — The Algorithm + server-authoritative trends.** Lobby aggregates `feedAlgorithm` into
  `AlgorithmState` (feeds/decay/tiers per `04` §12.5) and broadcasts it; Discover renders the
  world-boss meter bar (`06` §4); the tier multiplier folds into `recomputeStats()` (like
  `boonMultiplier`); BLESSED grants the guaranteed 2nd modifier in `startRun`. Move trend rotation
  from the client 90s timer (3.1) into the lobby `trends` broadcast; going live on a trend pushes
  its heat for everyone. Migrate the leaderboard `score` flow into the lobby; retire
  `party/src/trend.ts` + `useTrendRoom`.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.3–7.4, `03` §6, `04` §12.5, `06` §4, `02` §6. **DoD:** two windows see identical
  trends + meter; activity (stream/watch/gift) raises the meter; crossing FED multiplies income
  ×1.10 in both; single-window solo play still works offline (STARVED fallback, local trend
  fallback if the socket is down); typecheck.
  > note: decay + trend rotation run on a 30s `party.storage.setAlarm` (re-armed each tick) plus
  > lazy elapsed-time decay on every `feedAlgorithm`/connect, matching the existing in-memory
  > `streams`/`streamerConns` precedent (no Durable Object storage persistence). Added
  > `algoFedMult`/`algoBlessedMult` (1.10/1.25) to `BALANCE.social` per `04` §12.5. `algorithm` is
  > typed non-null in `socialSlice` (deviates from `03` §6's `AlgorithmState | null`) with an
  > exported `STARVED_ALGORITHM` default so `recomputeStats()`/UI never need null-checks; offline
  > fallback in `useLobby` resets to `STARVED_ALGORITHM` + restarts the local 90s
  > `generateTrends()` rotation on socket close. `rollModifiers()` gained an optional
  > `guaranteedSecondPool` param (filtered for conflicts) used only when BLESSED. Added
  > `lobbySendRef` to `socketRefs.ts` so `spectateSlice.sendViewerGift` can feed `giftCoins` without
  > prop drilling. Verified live: two-socket probe pushed the meter STARVED→FED→BLESSED, Discover's
  > `AlgorithmBar` updated in real time (×1.10/×1.25 buff text + tick marks), `recomputeStats()`
  > `multiplier` reflected the tier mult, a BLESSED run rolled a guaranteed second modifier
  > (`viral_moment`), and stopping the party server fell back to STARVED + local trend rotation
  > with no console errors.

> **4.5 split (2026-06-11):** the original single 4.5 bundled four distinct features — too large for
> one session. Split into 4.5a/4.5b/4.5c, done in order; each gets its own typecheck pass + commit.

- [x] **4.5a — Supabase auth (anonymous-upgradeable) + cloud save sync.** Add the Supabase adapter
  at the `meta.ts` serialize boundary (`02` §4); anonymous sign-in on first load, upgradeable to a
  real account via email link; cloud save sync.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.4, `02` §4. **DoD:** sign in (anonymously), save syncs across two devices.
  > note: created Supabase project "ClickTok" (`zdqnsizzhmkzirrrhnsa`); `client/.env` (gitignored)
  > holds `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/`VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`. New `public.saves` table (`user_id` PK →
  > `auth.users`, `handle`, `data jsonb`, `save_version`, `updated_at`), RLS scoped to
  > `auth.uid() = user_id`. Required enabling "Anonymous Sign-Ins" in the dashboard's auth
  > providers (no MCP tool exposes this config). `client/src/lib/supabase.ts` exports a `supabase`
  > client that's `null` when env vars are unset — cloud sync becomes a no-op
  > (`cloudSyncStatus: "offline"`) so the game stays fully local-only without Supabase configured.
  > Extracted `meta.ts`'s `partialize` shape into a shared `toPersistedState(state)` (used by both
  > the localStorage `persist` middleware and cloud push, so the two targets can't drift). New
  > `cloudSlice` (ephemeral: `cloudUserId`/`cloudIsAnonymous`/`cloudEmail`/`cloudSyncStatus`, plus
  > `loadPersistedState()` — the reverse of `toPersistedState`, reused for cloud-pull hydration).
  > `features/cloud/sync.ts` (`pullCloudSave`/`pushCloudSave`) + `hooks/useCloudSync.ts` (mounted in
  > `Shell`): on mount, signs in anonymously if no session, then last-write-wins sync — a separate
  > localStorage key `clicktok-cloud-synced-at` (NOT part of `PersistedState`/`SAVE_VERSION`, since
  > `lastSeenAt` is a session-start timestamp, not a save timestamp) tracks the last cloud
  > `updated_at` this device has applied; pulls if the cloud row is newer, else pushes. Re-pushes
  > every 30s and on `visibilitychange`. New `components/CloudAccountPanel.tsx` on Profile shows
  > sync status (OFFLINE/SIGNING-IN/SYNCING/SYNCED/ERROR) and an email-link form
  > (`supabase.auth.updateUser({email})` — anonymous→permanent upgrade, same `user.id`, so the
  > existing cloud save carries over). Verified end-to-end live: anonymous sign-in created a
  > `saves` row with the correct wallet/version; `loadPersistedState` correctly re-hydrates
  > `wallet`/`handle`/`ownedUpgrades`/etc. and recomputes derived stats; a push→reload round trip
  > pulled the pushed state back down.

- [x] **4.5b — Durable leaderboards.** Move the lobby's in-memory leaderboard (4.4) into Supabase
  so it survives a PartyKit restart; global and per-trend views.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.4. **DoD:** leaderboard data survives a PartyKit restart.
  > note: new `public.leaderboard_scores` table (`user_id` PK → `auth.users`, `handle`, `followers`,
  > `likes`, `trend`, `updated_at`), RLS public-SELECT-only — writes happen server-side from the
  > lobby room using `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (bypasses RLS). New `party/.env`/`.env.example`
  > (both gitignored except the example) hold `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`; when
  > unset, `supabaseConfig()` returns `null` and the lobby behaves exactly like the pre-4.5b
  > in-memory-only leaderboard (no crash, just no durability) — the service role key still needs
  > to be filled in from the dashboard for persistence to actually activate.
  > Channels are now keyed by stable `cloudUserId` (from 4.5a's anonymous-upgradeable auth) when
  > present, falling back to the ephemeral PartyKit connection id for guests — only durable
  > (logged-in) entries get persisted/restored across restarts. `onStart()` calls
  > `loadLeaderboard()`, which fetches the top 100 rows ordered by `followers desc` from Supabase
  > to seed `this.channels`. `score` messages debounce writes per-user (min 10s between upserts) to
  > avoid hammering Supabase on the 2s score tick.
  > Per-trend leaderboard ("TRENDING #topic") uses a request/response pair
  > (`getTrendLeaderboard`/`trendLeaderboard`) instead of a broadcast, since each viewer may be on a
  > different trend; `useLobby` requests it on connect and whenever `activeTrend` changes.
  > `ChannelSummary` gained an optional `trend` field; `rankedChannels()`/new
  > `trendRankedChannels()` both slice to top 10 for display. `Leaderboard.tsx` extracted a shared
  > `LeaderboardSection` for "TOP CREATORS" (global) and "TRENDING #topic" (per-trend), each
  > hidden if empty. Verified in browser preview: both sections render on Discover with the local
  > player highlighted; `pnpm typecheck` passes for client + party.
  > Also noted (pre-existing, unrelated to this task): a "React has detected a change in the order
  > of Hooks" console warning for `Shell` reproduces on clean `main` too — not a regression from
  > this change, left as-is.

> **4.5c re-scope (2026-06-11, post-ship security review):** a review of `party/src/stream.ts` +
> `lobby.ts` found the trust gaps are broader than "reward validation": no role checks (any viewer
> can hijack `open`, broadcast `end` to kick spectators, or forge `shoutout` follower grants), no
> ownership checks (`liveUpdate`/`endLive` accept any sender; `score` trusts a client-sent
> `userId` and persists forgeries via the service role), unbounded amounts (`hypeTap.taps`,
> `feedAlgorithm`), and unguarded `JSON.parse` in both `onMessage`s. Split into c-1 (hardening, no
> new infra) and c-2 (verified identity). NOTE the accepted limit: saves are a client-pushed blob,
> so a player can always cheat **their own** wallet — the goal here is that players cannot spoof
> *each other* or the shared state (leaderboard, directory, Algorithm, shoutouts).

- [x] **4.5c-1 — Party-server hardening (no new infra).** In `party/src/stream.ts`: pin the
  streamer role — the first `open` wins until that connection closes; only the pinned connection's
  `snapshot`/`pollOpen`/`pollClose`/`shoutout`/`end` are honored (drop streamer-typed messages
  from viewers, and viewer-typed messages from the streamer); recompute `shoutout.followers`
  server-side per `04` §12.7 (ignore the client value); clamp `hypeTap.taps` to
  `HARDEN.maxTapsPerMsg`; enforce `minQuickChatIntervalMs` per connection; clear `votesByPoll` on
  `end`. In `party/src/lobby.ts`: honor `liveUpdate`/`endLive` only when
  `streamerConns.get(sender.id) === streamId`; reject `goLive` for a `streamId` already owned by
  a *different* connection; bind the leaderboard key once at `hello` (a later `score.userId`
  switch is ignored for that connection); clamp + rate-limit `feedAlgorithm` per `04` §12.7. Both
  files: wrap the `onMessage` body in try/catch and silently drop malformed messages.
  **Refs:** `04` §12.7, `03` §6, `02` §6. **DoD:** a raw-WebSocket node probe (like the 4.4/5.1
  verifications) demonstrates each forgery is ignored: viewer `open` hijack, viewer-sent `end`,
  forged `shoutout` value, a 9999-tap message (capped to 8), `endLive` on someone else's stream,
  and a `feedAlgorithm` flood (meter rises by ≤ the clamped, rate-limited amount). Normal
  two-window play (stream + spectate + gift + poll) still works; typecheck.
  > note: `HARDEN` const block (exactly §12.7) added to both party files, comment-linked to that
  > section. `SHOUTOUT_FOLLOWERS_PER_LEVEL = 50` added as a separate server-side const in
  > `stream.ts` (linked to §12.3) since it's not part of the `HARDEN` block but is needed for
  > server-side recomputation. The `open` handler allows the same connection to re-send `open`
  > (updates `streamerSummary`) — "first open wins" means first *connection* wins; re-sending from
  > the pinned conn is harmless and lets the summary stay fresh. `feedAlgorithm` `"streamStarted"`
  > kind is not clamped (it's a fixed server-side increment with no client-controlled magnitude).
  > `pnpm typecheck` passes; 13/13 probe assertions pass (`probe-4.5c1.mjs`, run against local
  > PartyKit dev server at 127.0.0.1:1999).

- [x] **4.5c-2 — Verified identity (Supabase JWT → PartyKit).** Client: append the Supabase
  `access_token` to BOTH party sockets' connection URLs (PartySocket `query: { token }`, value
  from `supabase.auth.getSession()`; omit when null). Server (lobby + stream room): in
  `onConnect`, read `token` from the request URL and verify it via
  `GET {SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1/user` with headers `apikey: <SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY>`,
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → on 200, bind the returned `user.id` to the connection (store
  in a conn→userId map; one fetch per connection). Lobby: the verified id replaces any
  client-sent `hello.userId`/`score.userId` as the leaderboard key (per the `03` §6 auth note);
  connections without a verified id are guests — full gameplay, in-memory leaderboard only,
  **never persisted** to Supabase. Preserve current behavior when Supabase env vars are unset
  (local/offline dev: everyone is a guest).
  **Refs:** `03` §6 (auth note), `02` §6. **DoD:** probe A (no token) sends `score` with probe
  B's real `userId` → B's `leaderboard_scores` row is untouched and A appears only as an
  in-memory guest; an authenticated socket's `score` persists to its own row; killing Supabase
  env vars locally still yields a working lobby; typecheck for client + party.
  > note: `query` is a lazy async function (PartySocket supports `() => Promise<Params>`) so
  > the token is fetched right before connection and refreshed on reconnect — no token is stored
  > in client state. `ctx.request.url` used in both lobby and stream `onConnect` to read the
  > query param; `conn.uri` would also work. `connUserIds` map in lobby replaces the 4.5b
  > `hello.userId` trust path for the leaderboard key and persistence decision. Stream room
  > binds the verified id but does not yet use it in message handling (no DoD requirement).
  > `probe-4.5c2.mjs` (5/5 assertions pass) includes a 12s wait for the persistence debounce
  > to prove the authenticated row write end-to-end; guest tests are sub-second. An initial
  > probe bug (drain not awaited → stale leaderboard picked up by waitFor) was found and fixed
  > before the final run. Prod deploy still needed — see note below.

---

## PHASE 5 — Ship it (deployment + pre-launch hygiene)

Architecture (decided 2026-06-11): **client → Vercel** (static Vite build), **realtime server →
PartyKit Cloud** via `partykit deploy` (PartyKit is a stateful WebSocket platform on Cloudflare —
it cannot run on Vercel), **Supabase** is already cloud-hosted. Secrets NEVER go in git: local
values live in `party/.env` / `client/.env` (both gitignored, already filled); production copies
are pushed to each platform's own env store. Interactive CLI logins (`partykit login`,
`vercel login`) are completed by the human operator when prompted.

- [x] **5.0 — Fix the Shell hooks-order bug.** Console shows "React has detected a change in the
  order of Hooks" for `Shell` (`client/src/app/Shell.tsx`), pre-existing on `main` (see 4.5b note).
  Reproduce via `pnpm dev` → console → navigate Home → go live → end → back. Find the conditional
  hook (likely around the Live/spectate overlay switch on `phase`); restructure so every hook runs
  unconditionally each render (move early returns below hooks, or split a child component).
  **DoD:** warning no longer appears across a full navigate → live → results → back cycle;
  `pnpm typecheck` passes.
  > note: investigated — every hook in `Shell` and its child hooks (`useGameLoop`, `useLobby`,
  > `useStreamerRoom`, `useSpectatorRoom`, `useCloudSync`) is called unconditionally at the top
  > level; the `phase`/`spectating`/`pendingDrop` branch only affects JSX, not hook calls. Mapped
  > the warning's "Previous render" hook list (76 entries, diverging at #76: `useEffect` vs
  > `useCallback`) against `useLobby`'s hook positions and found it matches exactly the *pre-4.5b*
  > 9-selector version of `useLobby` (before `setTrendLeaderboard`/`activeTrend` were added),
  > while "Next render" matches the current 11-selector version — i.e. it was a stale-fiber
  > Fast-Refresh artifact from editing `useLobby.ts` mid-session, not a Rules-of-Hooks violation
  > in the source. Confirmed by restarting the dev server fresh and running multiple full
  > navigate → live → results → back cycles (+ tab switches): zero hooks-order warnings.
  > No code change required. `pnpm typecheck` passes.

- [x] **5.1 — Deploy the PartyKit server.** From `party/`: `npx partykit login` (operator completes
  the GitHub OAuth), then `npx partykit deploy` (project name `clicktok` per `partykit.json`).
  Push the two secrets the lobby needs, reading values from the local `party/.env` (do NOT echo
  them into logs or commit them): `npx partykit env add SUPABASE_URL`, `npx partykit env add
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, then redeploy so the env takes effect. Record the deployed host
  (`clicktok.<partykit-username>.partykit.dev`) in a `> note:` under this task.
  **DoD:** `curl https://<host>` (or opening a websocket from a local client pointed at it via
  `VITE_PARTYKIT_HOST=<host> pnpm dev:client`) reaches the deployed lobby; leaderboard writes land
  in Supabase `leaderboard_scores`.
  > note: deployed to `clicktok.dev-busters.partykit.dev` (already logged in as `dev-busters` via
  > Clerk, no interactive login needed). Pushed `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` from
  > `party/.env` via `npx partykit env add` (values never echoed/logged), then redeployed.
  > Verified via a raw WebSocket connection to `wss://clicktok.dev-busters.partykit.dev/parties/lobby/lobby`:
  > received `directory`/`trends`/`algorithm`/`leaderboard` on connect, and the `leaderboard`
  > payload already contained the real entries (`harrowed`, `algo_test_a`) previously persisted
  > to Supabase locally — confirming the deployed room's `onStart()` → `loadLeaderboard()`
  > correctly restores durable leaderboard state from `leaderboard_scores`. A `score` message with
  > a fake (non-`auth.users`) `userId` correctly did NOT persist (FK constraint), as expected.

- [x] **5.2 — Deploy the client to Vercel.** Create/link a Vercel project for this repo (CLI
  `vercel` from repo root, or the Vercel MCP/skill if connected). Settings: **Root Directory =
  `client`**, framework Vite (auto-detected), pnpm monorepo (Vercel detects
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml`; if install fails, set Install Command to `pnpm install` and enable
  "Include files outside Root Directory"). Set project env vars (Production):
  `VITE_PARTYKIT_HOST=<host from 5.1>`, `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (same
  values as local `client/.env` — the anon key is public-safe by design; the service-role key
  must NEVER be set here). Deploy to production.
  **DoD:** the production URL loads the game; onboarding → post → go live works; no console
  errors about localhost:1999.
  > note: deployed via `vercel --prod --yes`. Production URL: `https://clicktok-one.vercel.app`
  > (preview alias `clicktok-e2t8wabhf-artbyharrowed-1247s-projects.vercel.app`). Confirmed
  > Root Directory=`client`, all three env vars set on Production. Verified the built bundle
  > references `clicktok.dev-busters.partykit.dev` with zero `localhost:1999` occurrences.
  > Browser smoke test (Chrome DevTools MCP): onboarding (handle entry) → home feed loads with
  > live `~10 viewers` from the deployed PartyKit lobby → GO LIVE starts a run with working
  > hype meter, timer, modifiers, and live heart/comment feed. No console errors (only a
  > pre-existing minor a11y warning: "form field element should have an id or name attribute").

- [x] **5.3 — Production smoke test + Supabase URL config.** Add the Vercel production URL to
  Supabase Auth (dashboard → Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL / Redirect URLs) so
  auth flows work on the prod domain (the Supabase MCP cannot change this — operator does it in
  the dashboard if no tool exposes it). Then a two-browser test against the production URL:
  window A goes live; window B sees A in LIVE NOW, joins, sends a hype tap + quick-chat + gift;
  A sees them glowing in-feed; B gets a watch-drop on stream end; leaderboard shows both and
  still shows them after `partykit deploy` is re-run (durability).
  **DoD:** all of the above pass on production; record the prod URL in a `> note:`.

  > note: prod URL `https://clicktok-one.vercel.app`. Two isolated browser contexts
  > (`prodtest_user` streaming, `prodtest_spec` spectating) against production:
  > A went LIVE → B saw A in Discover → LIVE NOW, joined as spectator → B sent a hype tap (❤️)
  > and quick-chat ("W"), both appeared glowing in A's live feed in real time → B earned coins
  > via a watch-drop on a prior stream's end (+6 coins/+11 likes for 21s watched) and used them
  > to send a 🌹 Rose gift → gift appeared in A's feed, A's coin count rose +5, and A's results
  > screen showed "TOP GIFTER @prodtest_spec" with a working SHOUT OUT button → B received a
  > watch-drop on this stream's end too. Discover → TOP CREATORS showed both `prodtest_user`
  > and `prodtest_spec`, and TRENDING (#lifehacks) showed `prodtest_user`. Ran `npx partykit
  > deploy` to redeploy the lobby room, then re-checked Discover: both accounts still present
  > in TOP CREATORS (durability confirmed — Supabase-backed leaderboard survives a PartyKit
  > redeploy). No console errors throughout (only the pre-existing minor a11y warning noted in
  > 5.2). **Supabase Auth URL config not completed by this task** — the Supabase MCP is not
  > connected in this environment, so adding `https://clicktok-one.vercel.app` to
  > Authentication → URL Configuration → Site URL / Redirect URLs in the Supabase dashboard is
  > an outstanding manual step for the operator. The current auth flow uses
  > `signInAnonymously()` only, which does not require redirect URLs, so this does not block
  > any tested functionality but should be done before adding OAuth/email/magic-link flows.

## PHASE 6 — Liveness + hygiene (post-ship)

> Recommended order across phases: **4.5c-1 → 4.5c-2 → 6.1 → 3.5 (balance pass, still open in
> Phase 3 — do it here, with real prod playtests) → 6.2 → 6.3 → 6.4 → 6.5.** Every task is
> independently shippable; production stays live throughout, so verify nothing regresses solo play
> before checking a box.

- [ ] **6.1 — Featured sim streams (cold-start filler).** `01` §7.4 promises sim "featured
  streams" so an empty directory never looks dead. Lobby: pad the `directory` broadcast up to
  `featuredMinDirectory` cards with `featured: true` entries (a server-side pool of ≥8 fake
  handles/topics; `creatorLevel` rolled 2–4 each; viewers/hype drift a little on each alarm tick;
  rotate fillers out/in every few minutes so the rail doesn't look frozen). Real streams always
  sort first and displace fillers one-for-one. Client: featured cards show a small ✨ FEATURED
  badge (`06` §4); tapping one opens spectator mode driven by a NEW client-local snapshot
  simulator (`features/livestream/simSpectate.ts`) instead of a socket — synthesize
  `RunStartParams` via `computeRunParams(metaFor(level), topic, heat)` with `metaFor(level)` =
  `{ followers: 10^(level-1), skills 0, no gear }`, then reuse the existing event spawner to
  push `SpectatorEvent`s + drifting meters through `applySnapshot` on a local interval. Viewer
  economy per `04` §12.8 (taps/gifts work; no jackpot/shoutout; drop ×`featuredDropMult`). Sim
  ends after `durationSec` → the normal drop sheet → back to Discover.
  **Refs:** `01` §7.4, `03` §6, `04` §12.8, `06` §4. **DoD:** with zero real streams, Discover
  shows `featuredMinDirectory` badged cards; joining one plays a live-feeling stream (meters and
  feed move, taps/gifts respond); the drop pays the ×0.5 formula; going live in a second window
  shows the real stream above the fillers; typecheck.

- [ ] **6.2 — Lobby efficiency: broadcast debounce + persist flush.** Every `score` message
  (clients send one every ~2s) currently triggers a full `leaderboard` broadcast to every
  connection — O(N²) as population grows. Debounce `broadcastLeaderboard` /
  `broadcastTrendLeaderboard` to at most one per 2s with a trailing edge (the final state always
  broadcasts). Separately, `persistScore`'s 10s per-user debounce silently drops trailing writes —
  in `onClose`, flush that connection's pending entry to Supabase bypassing the debounce.
  **Refs:** `02` §6. **DoD:** a node probe with 3+ connections sending rapid `score` storms
  observes ≤1 leaderboard broadcast per ~2s, ending with the final values; a probe that scores
  then immediately disconnects still gets its final values into `leaderboard_scores`; typecheck.

- [ ] **6.3 — Split the Live screen (pure refactor).** `client/src/screens/Live/index.tsx` is
  1,067 lines holding both roles. Extract `StreamerLive.tsx` and `SpectatorLive.tsx` (plus shared
  pieces like the results/drop sheets) so each file is ≲400 lines; `index.tsx` becomes the mode
  switch. **Zero behavior change** — move code, don't edit logic; resist drive-by fixes.
  **Refs:** `06` §7. **DoD:** typecheck; a full streamer run AND a spectate session verified in
  preview with no visual or behavioral diffs.

- [ ] **6.4 — README.** Root `README.md`: what the game is (one paragraph + the prod URL),
  quickstart (`pnpm install`, `pnpm dev`, copy `client/.env.example` + `party/.env.example` and
  fill from your own Supabase project), architecture map (Vercel client + PartyKit realtime +
  Supabase persistence, with the prod hosts), the docs/ read order + roadmap workflow for
  contributors/models, and the deploy runbook (the 5.1/5.2 commands). **No secrets** — env var
  *names* only.
  **Refs:** `CLAUDE.md`, `05` Phase 5 notes. **DoD:** a fresh clone reaches a running local game
  following only the README.

- [ ] **6.5 — Code-split the bundle.** The client ships one ~640KB JS chunk. `React.lazy` the
  Live screen (Suspense fallback matching the dark phone frame) and add a Rollup `manualChunks`
  vendor split (react/react-dom, framer-motion, @supabase/supabase-js). Don't split further than
  that — diminishing returns.
  **DoD:** initial JS chunk < 350KB (`pnpm build` output); full play-through (post → go live →
  results → spectate) works in preview with no chunk-load errors.

## How to update this file
When you finish a task: change `[ ]`→`[x]`, and if you deviated from the spec, add a one-line
`> note:` under it explaining what changed and why (so the next model and the docs stay honest).
